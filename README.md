Project created in vanilla JavaScript. In this project I have integrated REST Countries API to pull country data and display it.

Users are able to:
- see all countries on the homepage
- search for a country using an input field
- filter countries by region
- click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- click through to the border countries on the detail page
- toggle the colour scheme between light and dark mode

This project is only desktop responsive.
